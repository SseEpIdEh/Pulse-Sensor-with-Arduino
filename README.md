The heart rate sensor measures your heart rate in Beats per Minute using an optical LED light source and an LED light sensor.

BPM:Beats Per Minutes ðŸ’“

Componet requirement:
1. Pulse sensor 
2. Arunio Nano/uno....
3. hook and loop for fasten(optinal)


**Please take a look a t the circuit diagram in  "Pulse Sensor_cd.jpg"

# SETUP:  
If you take look at the sensor , there are three wires with different colors ,  S means signal , positive (+) and negative(-)

S--> connect to A0 
+--> 5V 
---> GND


# Lest CODE:

STEP 1: add the library to your Arduino IDE ----> Pulse-Sensor.zip
 # HOW: GO TO SKTECH --> ICLUDE LIBRARY --> Add .zip library
